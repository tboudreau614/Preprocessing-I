      <h1>Work History</h1>
        <p>
          My primary two careers were at AMC Theatres and DISH Network. At AMC I was a Theater Maintenance Technician, which taught me a lot about how to work independently and my experience there has proven to be invaluable. At DISH Network I was a Sales Representative at the Account Executive level. This opportunity truly showed me what it's like to work in a customer-facing environment. Though I was speaking to potential clients over the phone, I learned a lot about how to handle client negotiations. Because this was a Sales position it allowed me to see directly how customers felt about the company's Marketing material and website interface which showed me what people did and did not like about the site. This is very valuable to me in the field of Web Development because it allowed me to understand accessibility before I even entered the realm of Development.
